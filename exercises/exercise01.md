## Question 1

**Compare and contrast the data types used for:**
- `country.Population`
- `country.LifeExpectancy`

Why were these data types selected?

### Answer

- The country.Population field is stored using an Integer data type. Generally, population fields store whole numbers without fractions but they can be big numbers up in millions. In this case, it is the ideal type for storage purposes as it only uses only 4 bytes (32 bits) per entry. We use minimal memory space while hitting our target data type. 

- The country.LifeExpectancy field is stored using Decimal (3,1). Unlike population which is a whole number, life expectancy is a quotient and can be a decimal(float). 

### Screenshot
_Show the table structure or DESCRIBE output._

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 2

**What is the data type of `country.IndepYear`?**
Why do you think this data type was selected?

### Answer
The country.IndepYear is using smallint because year field is a whole number and does not exceed 32,767. It is very efficient memorywise as it occupies only 2 bytes (16 bits). 
### Screenshot

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 3

**Make a case for a different data type for `country.IndepYear`.**
Explain why your proposed data type might be better in some situations.

### Answer
We could use YEAR (1 byte) data type which is half size of SMALLINT
