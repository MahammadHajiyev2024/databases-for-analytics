## Instructions

- Answer each question below using SQL executed against the **World database**.
- All SQL commands **must be run by you**.
- For each SQL-based question:
  - Include the SQL command in a fenced code block
  - Include a **screenshot** showing the command and its results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.

## Question 1

When importing records from `worldPGSQL.sql`, **how many cities were imported**?

### Answer
4079

### Screenshot
_Show evidence of how you determined this (for example, a COUNT query)._

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT (*)
FROM City 
```

## Question 2

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **display each country name along with the name of each language spoken in that country**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.name, cl.language
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN countrylanguage AS cl ON c.code = cl.countrycode
ORDER BY c.name ASC
```

## Question 3

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **display each country name along with the name of each official language spoken in that country**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.name AS country_name, cl.language AS official_language
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN countrylanguage AS cl ON c.code = cl.countrycode
WHERE cl.isofficial ='T'
ORDER BY c.name ASC
```

## Question 4

Consider the following two SQL statements:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country, countrylanguage
WHERE country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM country
LEFT OUTER JOIN countrylanguage
ON country.code = countrylanguage.countrycode;
```

**In your own words**, describe what data the **second query returns that the first query does not**.

### Answer

The second query is using left outer join whereby includes each and every country name even if there is no language for some countries. First join is implicit and won't return the countries that have not been assigned any language.

## Question 5

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all different forms of government** found in the data.
Do **not** repeat any form of government more than once.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT c.governmentform 
FROM country AS c
ORDER BY governmentform
```

## Question 6

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all names of cities and countries in one column**.
Label the column **"City or Country Name"**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.name AS Country_or_City 
FROM country AS c
UNION 
SELECT ci.name AS Country_or_City
FROM city AS ci
ORDER BY Country_or_City ASC
```

## Question 7

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all countries by name**, along with the **number of languages spoken in each country**.
Be sure to **sort by country name**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.name AS country, (COUNT(DISTINCT cl.language)) AS num_of_languages
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN countrylanguage AS cl ON c.code = cl.countrycode
GROUP BY c.name 
```

## Question 8

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list all languages**, along with the **number of countries where each language is spoken**.
Be sure to **sort by language name**.

### SQL

```sql
SELECT cl.language, COUNT(cl.countrycode) AS num_of_countries_spoken
FROM countrylanguage AS cl
GROUP BY cl.language
ORDER BY cl.language
```

## Question 9

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **list countries that have more than two official languages**, along with the **number of official languages spoken**.

*Hint: There are 8 such countries in this dataset.*

### SQL

```sql
SELECT c.name, COUNT(cl.language) AS number_of_official_languages
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN countrylanguage AS cl ON c.code = cl.countrycode
WHERE isofficial = 'T' 
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(cl.language) > 2
ORDER BY c.name 
```

## Question 10

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **find cities where the district value is missing**.

*Hint: Use `LIKE` and the dash (`-`) since some rows use that instead of actual data.*

### SQL

```sql
SELECT name, district 
FROM city
WHERE district IS NULL OR district = '' OR (district LIKE '–%' OR district LIKE '-%')  
ORDER BY name;
```

## Question 11

Using the World database, write the SQL command to **calculate the percentage of cities with missing district values**.

*Hint: The result should be approximately 0.4%.*

### SQL

```sql
SELECT 
ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN district IS NULL OR district = '' OR (district LIKE '–%' OR district LIKE '-%') THEN 1 END) 
* 100.0 / COUNT (DISTINCT id),2)  AS percentage_of_cities_missing_district 
FROM City
```
